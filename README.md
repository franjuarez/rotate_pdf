# rotate_pdf
A user friendly program that allows users to rotate their PDF pages.

It can be used by simply running the .exe file and specifying the pdf name, the range of pages you want to rotate and the rotation angle.
The program and the PDF need to be in the same folder.
Creates a new file called new_{file name}.pdf. 

In this version it rotates one every 2 pages, starting by rotating the first one. (Should be changed in future version)
