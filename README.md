# rotate_pdf
A user friendly program that allows users to rotate specific pages of their PDFs.
It rotates one every a certain amount of pages (decided by the user), starting by rotating the first one in the specified range.

It can be used by simply running the .exe file and specifying the pdf name, the range of pages you want to rotate, every how many pages you want to rotate and the rotation angle.
The program and the PDF need to be in the same folder.
Creates a new file called new_{file name}.pdf. 

You can also browse the code if you want to :)
